            Starring - Kamal Haasan,

            The film is celebrated for its action sequences, whistle-worthy moments, and the performances of Kamal, VJS, and FF.
            Kamal Haasan's presence, though limited in the first half, is impactful, and FF's role as Amar has been particularly appreciated.
